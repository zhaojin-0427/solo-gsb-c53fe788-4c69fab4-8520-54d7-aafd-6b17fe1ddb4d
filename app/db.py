"""PostgreSQL access: connection pool, revision lookup and publishing.

All conditional decisions run inside a transaction that locks the
``objects`` row of the path (``SELECT ... FOR SHARE`` for reads,
``FOR UPDATE`` for writes).  Concurrent publishes therefore serialise on
that row, and a streaming GET keeps its share lock until the body has
been fully sent, so the revision selected for the headers can neither
disappear nor be replaced while bytes are streamed.

Every writer takes the ``objects`` row lock *before* touching
``revisions``: the locking statement selects the object row alone
(no join), so even an empty placeholder row (``current_id`` NULL) is
locked; the current revision is read in a separate statement only after
the locks are held.  Locking through an INNER JOIN instead would return
nothing for such a row -- no lock -- letting a first publisher insert
revision 1 before it blocks, which deadlocks against a concurrent
acknowledgement that already holds the placeholder.

Copy sessions reuse the same building blocks: the manifest is captured
with ``FOR SHARE`` snapshots, and acknowledging a segment first locks all
target rows of the batch -- empty placeholders included -- in one
ascending-path ``FOR UPDATE`` statement, then reads their current
revisions inside the held locks and applies its entries (so concurrent
acknowledgements cannot deadlock).

When a session is created a *revision baseline* is recorded for every
target path in the same snapshot transaction (a NULL revision means the
target did not exist).  Acknowledgements compare the locked target's
current revision identity against that baseline: any publish after the
baseline -- even of byte-identical content -- is reported as a conflict,
because a digest match alone cannot distinguish "unchanged" from
"re-published since the session was pinned".

Revision reclamation (``POST /gc``) deletes historical revisions, but
only ones nothing can still reach: the execute path locks every
requested object row ``FOR UPDATE`` in one ascending-path statement --
the same global order publishers, session creation and acknowledgements
use -- and only then classifies revisions inside the held locks.  A
revision is deleted solely when, at that locked moment, it is not the
object's current revision and no copy-session manifest entry or target
baseline references it, so a concurrent PUT, session creation,
acknowledgement or streaming GET can never lose a revision it is using
nor be left with a dangling reference.

    This is deliberately TWO statements, and the order matters:

    1. Lock every objects row (placeholder rows are inserted first) in a
       plain ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` -- no join with ``revisions`` --
       so even an empty ``current_id`` NULL placeholder is locked.  A
       lock query that INNER JOINs revisions returns no row for such a
       placeholder and locks nothing, letting a concurrent first publish
       race the apply (both inserting revision 1, or a 500 instead of a
       conflict).  Rows are taken in ascending path order -- the same
       global order used by session creation (FOR SHARE) and one-row
       PUTs -- so concurrent acks, publishes and session creations
       serialise without deadlocks.
    2. Only after EVERY target row is locked, LEFT JOIN revisions and
       read the current revision identity.  The read cannot block and
       cannot go stale while the batch runs: writers always take this
       same object row lock before inserting a revision, and we now hold
       it for every target until commit/rollback.  Folding the read into
       statement 1 would mix per-row locking with the snapshot: a
       row locked early could be published by another transaction
       between that point and the later ``max(revision_no)``, letting a
       waking ack insert a ghost revision numbered max+1 instead of
       seeing the publish and reporting the conflict.
